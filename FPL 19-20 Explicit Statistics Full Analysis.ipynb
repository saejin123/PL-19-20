    "The Fantasy Premier League (FPL) 2020/2021 is avalible now to create your own team for the 2020/2021 Premier League season. FPL is a game that determines who can select the best players based on their statistical performances. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick summary of FPL, we are given 100 million pounds in the game, and the goal is to buy the players who will accumulate the most points in terms of their statistical performances. The points can come from clean sheets, goals, assists, and other metrics like bonus points. The full sets of rules can be found at fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules. Obviously the better players are more expensive and the cheaper are less, so the ultimate goal is to optimize your team to produce the most points. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to analyze these players from underlying statistics like shots on goal, expected goals or explicit statistics like goals and assists. This analysis will only consist of the obvious statistics to look at – the goals, assists, and value statistics. The next analysis will dive deeper into the underlying statistics like teams that might've overperformed or underperformed last season, and the final analysis will be summarizing both findings and selecting the final team. The goal for this analysis is to find the best players from last season just from their visibile statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting this is the data from the 2019-2020 Premier League season. Although we are looking at past data and should not always extrapolate off it, the most recent data is a great place to start and provides a solid picture of a player's future performances. In addition, the brief analysis in my previous post does not include the recent changes made by FPL for the 2020/2021 season. There has been big changes in player prices and some changes in player positions. For example, as expected John Lundstram is now a midfielder, and his price has rose from 4.6 million to 5.5 million. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first import the modules to create dataframes, plots, and extract the data from the FPL API."

    "These are the top 10 most valuable players. Nick Pope from Burnley has played every single match last season, so he has produced an impressive 15 clean sheets in 38 matches. Oddly, there are only goalkeepers and defenders which could be from how cheap defenders and goalkeepers usually are. The only slightly expensive players are Alexander-Arnold (7.5), Doherty (6.5), and van Dijk (6.5). Alexander-Arnold and Doherty are players who love to get involved attacking on the wing as shown by their high number of assists and a couple goals. Van Dijk is also a player who loves to go forward to possibly score from a corner. All four players are attractive options."

    "Now we look at the best players in terms of points (and if tied, ranking on value). Last season, Kevin De Bruyne was the highest scoring player with 13 goals, 23 assists, and 18 clean sheets. Even after the price increase, he still has great value out of the top 10 highest scoring players, still a must-have player. One interesting player here is Trent Alexander Arnold. Being the 6th most valuable player overall, he is also the 4th highest scoring player overall and the most valuable player in this list. So far, it looks like De Bruyne and Alexander-Arnold are essential to have. Salah, Mane, and Vardy look to be the next attractive picks with their high number of points and decent value, and Martial, Ings, and Jimenez for budget options."

    "It was mentioned before that points per 90 (pp90) is the amount of points a player produces on average every 90 minutes. It was also said that pp90 isn't the best indicator of a player's performance as there are certain situations that would distort its value. It can be a double-edged sword as we can find out about how players who transferred in mid-season performed, but it could greatly award players who played only one great game. This is why  we decided to filter out players who played less than 570 minutes. The Premier League consists of 38 games, and we thought it was reasonable to use 19 games * 30 minutes = 570 minutes since a player who doesn't even play 30 minutes a game for half a season isn't a starter player. This is not the best way to filter out players who do not play as much; however, we believe it is reasonable to estimate this value. \n",

    "Fernandes is a perfect example of a player who transferred into Manchester United mid-season and had immediate impact. He has clearly changed the way Manchester United attack and this can be seen from his 8 goals and 8 assists  as well as his impact on the field. In the next analysis, we will confirm his presence on the field, but it is already very clear that he is a top player who looks to continue his form. \n",

    "It is very impressive that De Bruyne, Salah, Mane, and Sterling are on this list considering that they have played more than 2500 minutes and kept a fantastic pp90. Martial was 11th, and it was worth putting him on the list because he has the highest value and has played a lot (2625 minutes)."

Unfortunately near the end of the season, Lundstram did not seem to be nailed on the starting lineup, so he looks to be a risky pick. The variability of the value data points appears to be small, so it might be tough to select players from this table so a deeper analysis is needed. One thing remains – Kevin De Bruyne should be your first pick.\n",

Rice would be a good pick for reliability since he has played every minute of the season, and Noble, who has played less but scored more, would be better for more risky players. With 0.5 more, it looks like it would be more smart to get players like Henderson from Liverpool or Westwood from Burnley."

    "Danny Ings scored 22 goals and is the most valuable striker to own, even with his price increase from 6.5 to 8.5 million. The value of these strikers don't show great change from one another, so it is hard to differentiate them. Jordan Ayew is an interesting pick as he is not the flashiest player but has low cost and lots of minutes on the field. Jamie Vardy did have a fantastic season with 23 goals and 7 assists with reasonable value, but he is still expensive and getting older. A player who relies on his pace at the age of 33 will typically begin to wane unless he adapts.\n",

    "Origi from Liverpool appears to be the best bargain player by far except he has played considerably less minutes which probably inflated his pp90. If he had played more and continued his current statistics, it would reasonable to pick him for your team, though it looks like he will be continued to be benched by players like Salah and Mane. The cheaper forwards do not look to have much quality (total points ranging from 33 to 65), so it looks to be a better move to invest in a few expensive but good forwards and more cheaper more valuable defenders."

    "In summary, goalkeepers and defenders looks to be more valuable than midfielders and strikers. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the top 10 most valuable players table has no midfielders or forwards. Value isn't everything and so it's important to buy premium players, high quality players who come at a cost. Points per 90 minutes can be misleading but it could also help us find players who make the most of their time on the pitch. Bargain options are useful to look at in order to purchase backup options or squeeze in the last low cost outfield player. The suggests below offer what we feel are the best picks mostly based on the information in this analysis. The players could change especially after completing the underlying statistics analysis in the next analysis.\n",

For instance, Noble and  Rice for West Ham have very similar stats, but we need another side to the story – the influence, creativity, and threat (ICT index) on the pitch would indicate that a player is more likely to score or assist which directly leads to points. So an analysis with underlying indicators like the ICT index or expected goals could provide more insight on these players. This will done in the next analysis where we will bring players into consideration from those stats. The final analysis will bring both sides of the analysis together and confirm the top players to select.\n",
